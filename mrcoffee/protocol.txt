Protocol used by MRCoffee:

1. Client connects to MRCoffee.
2. Client writes length of command line.
3. Client writes command line, with arguments separated by nulls.
4. Client writes length of data for command's stdin.
5. Client writes data for command's stdin (if length > 0).
6. MRCoffee writes an int corresponding to the file descriptor which is
   the source of the data in the next block.
6. MRCoffee writes length of the data block. A zero-length block indicates
   that there will be no further data from that file descriptor.
7. MRCoffee writes the data (if length > 0).
8. Goto 6 if at least one of stdout and stderr is not finished.
9. Goto 2 if client has additional requests.
10. Client disconnects.

NOTES:

  * All numbers are big-endian. All lengths are sizeof(size_t) bytes.
  File descriptors are ints; we assume sizeof(int) == 4 bytes.
